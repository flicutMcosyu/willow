# Scienza delle costruzioni: A book by Luigi Gambarotta, Luciano Nunziante and Antonio Tralli
 
Scienza delle costruzioni (Science of constructions) is a book written by three Italian engineers and professors: Luigi Gambarotta, Luciano Nunziante and Antonio Tralli. The book covers the basic principles and methods of structural mechanics, with applications to beams, frames, plates, shells and foundations. The book also includes topics such as plasticity, stability, dynamics and fracture mechanics.

The book is divided into four parts. The first part introduces the basic concepts of structural mechanics, such as stress, strain, equilibrium, compatibility, constitutive laws and energy principles. The second part deals with the analysis of beams and frames under different loading and boundary conditions, including shear forces, bending moments, deflections and rotations. The third part covers the theory of plates and shells, with applications to thin-walled structures and membrane structures. The fourth part focuses on the foundations of structures, such as soil mechanics, bearing capacity, settlement and consolidation.
 
The book is rich in examples and exercises, which illustrate the theoretical concepts and help the reader to test their understanding. The book also provides references to other sources of information and further reading. The book is accompanied by a website that contains additional material, such as solutions to selected exercises, software tools and slides for lectures.
  
The authors of the book are well-known experts in the field of structural mechanics and engineering. Luigi Gambarotta is a professor of structural mechanics at the University of Genoa, where he teaches courses on structural analysis, plasticity and stability. He has published more than 100 papers on various topics of structural mechanics and engineering. Luciano Nunziante is an engineer and a consultant, who has worked on several projects involving structural design, assessment and retrofitting. He has also taught courses on structural mechanics, reinforced concrete and steel structures at different universities. Antonio Tralli is a professor of structural mechanics at the University of Ferrara, where he teaches courses on structural analysis, dynamics and fracture mechanics. He has published more than 80 papers on these topics and has been involved in several research projects.
 
The book is a comprehensive and up-to-date introduction to the science of constructions, which covers both the theoretical and practical aspects of structural mechanics and engineering. The book is suitable for students and professionals who want to learn or improve their knowledge and skills in this field. The book is also a useful resource for researchers who want to explore the latest developments and challenges in structural mechanics and engineering.
